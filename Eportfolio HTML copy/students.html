<p class="articletitle learnmtitle">The Students of Hogsmeade</p>

      <p class="learnp">In both the Primary and Secondary schools, the Student Councils aim to represent the social and academic wants and needs of the student body.</p>
      <p class="learnp">The Student Council helps to promote school spirit and unity and also has the aim of producing student leaders with the potential to embark on dynamic leadership roles that are involved in fund-raising activities, advising on school rules and regulations and the organisation of events reinforcing teamwork, leadership and compassion, especially in these times of COVID-19.</p>
      <p class="learnp">Hogsmeade International School has students from many nationalities, creating a diverse school environment. The variety of nationalities, cultures and backgrounds contribute to this uniqueness and make the school a centre for different values, beliefs, and cultures. It is the students’ responsibility and duty to encourage and respect them.</p>
      <p class="learnp">The goals of the Student Council are to create a comfortable and safe environment with clear communication and understanding amongst the students and teachers alike, as well as to shape a community in which all students respect and appreciate each other’s cultural diversity.</p>
      <p class="learnp">We can be proud of our unique qualities and backgrounds without compromising our respect for and appreciation of others. Through this mission statement the Student Council intend that school will be a thriving environment of learning and understanding both inside and outside the classroom.</p>
      <p class="learnp">In uncertain times, such as these, it is important for the Hogsmeade Community to show a united front and strive to improve our new normal. This is why the Student Council is arguably more important now than ever. Our aim is to ensure that all student activities are not only fun, but safe, as we put the health of our student body first and foremost. With mutual respect and cooperation, our school will thrive, and we will come out of this unique experience together, with a smile on our faces.</p>
