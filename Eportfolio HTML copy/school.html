      <p class="learnp">We believe that it is never too early to open your child's mind to the world.</p>
      <p class="learnp">Hogsmeade International School is an international community school that is committed to giving every child a truly global learning experience.</p>
      <p class="learnp">The School was founded in 1860s by the late entrepreneur and philanthropist, Carl Roger Douglass, and has grown to become one of the leading international schools in England.</p>
      <p class="learnp">Our mission is to provide students with a high quality international education which places a strong emphasis on fostering respect for other people’s identity and culture.</p>
      <p class="learnp">Our vision is to promote an active interest in learning, enabling students to acquire the skills, attitudes and qualifications necessary for them to become successful, responsible citizens. This is achieved through the provision of a challenging curriculum which develops critical, principled thinking within a positive learning environment and which addresses the students’ academic, social, emotional, physical, technological, aesthetic and moral needs.</p>
