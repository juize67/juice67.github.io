<p class="articletitle">About Us, The 'Magic of Hogsmeade'</p>

      <p class="aboutusp1 articlep">We are a student-made club that is dedicated to introducing the school, its environment to new students and to integrate new students into the school community. We currently has 23 active members and support from the Hogsmeade International School, as well as countless resources which it used to spread its knowledge around with everybody that needed them. This website is one of the group's most important assets and it was carefully made by Joshua Santos Smith, an expert coder and student within the school of Hogsmeade, as well as various others who helped during the development of this website. After they finished it the website was the most accomplished, detailed, user-friendly guide on your journey at Hogsmeade International School, and has been used by thousands who came to the school.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="aboutusp2 articlep">We regularly help students cope with the workload of Hogsmeade International and help them become familiar with the environment. On this website you will find information on the school's classes, teachers, students, history, events, gym, extracurricular activities, auditorium performances, student and school clubs, arts center and the community center. That is a lot of information to grasp at first but we have given out those information so that you can easily understand it all, and there is no worry if you don't understand everything, you will understand it eventually just by reading on our website, asking for some help and spend some time in Hogsmeade International. Trust us, you will have a good experience here at Hogsmeade.</p><img class="article1welimg" src="pictures/welcome.png">
