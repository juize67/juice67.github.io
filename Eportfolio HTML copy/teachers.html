That's right, we have truly the most accomplished education team to teach you on our subjects studied at school. Here you will get some insight to some world class notable teachers that we have at Hogsmeade International.</p>
      <p class="titlep2">Arthur Weasley</p>
      <p class="learnp">Arthur was a graduate of the Scottish Magna Carta Educational Institute and had a doctor's degree in biochemics as well as politics. He can be said to be one of the most diverse teachers we have at Hogsmeade. He teaches high level chemistry and politics, as well as some economics which is also his strongpoint as a graduate from the Magna Carta Institute, and if you have him as a teacher you will definitely learn a whole lot, with no regrets.</p>
      <p class="titlep2">Hernald Schweirer</p>
      <p class="learnp">This well known Austrian professor was once friends with Albert Einstein, and now he is in his late 70s teaching physics and advanced mathematics. We all know him, the world knows him, he has made many contributions to mankind such as his one-of-a-kind hydroliquid thermopropellor that allowed ships to travel underwater at an unprecedented speed. Here at Hogsmeade he will be life-changing if you get him as your physics or maths teacher and he will definitely make the most out of you at all times!</p>
      <p class="titlep2">Verella Angelton</p>
      <p class="f2f learnp">As one of the most accomplished female literature teachers in the world, Verella will teach you anything you need to know about the literature of multiple commonly used languages, such as English, Spanish, Chinese, French, German and more! Trust me, if you are into literature, you will be sucked right in her lessons. As a graduate from Cambridge, she also knows proper manners and can teach you some if you don't know it (pun intended)</p>
